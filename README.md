## Description
Bascially, this project aims to code a LEGO Ev3 robot to rescue victims at different locations, which are in fact color papers in the arena. The difficult part is that the robot does not know its own location in the beginning, which means it needs to figure out its location before it can go for the victims. The localization task is done by using ultrasonic sensor and color sensor to detect the real environment around the robot and remove possible positions until only one position is possible.
